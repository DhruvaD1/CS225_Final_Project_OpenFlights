# Team Contract

## Communication
###### Team Meetings
Our team will meet once a week every wednesday over discord for 30 minutes. One member will take notes to note down the deliverables for the following week. If something comes up, we should all be flexible to make changes to the meeting duration. In addition, if any members are not avaiable during the allocated meeting time, we should be open to moving the time around to work with other's schedules.

###### Assistance

We can contact each other via discord messages in the group chat or via text messages. We should ensure responses within a day to have effective communication between one another. Also actively checking the group chats for updates. If needed we should be flexible to meeting outside of the allocated weekly time slot for unforseen errors.

###### Respect
We will listen to everyone's idea and use majority to decide the decision making. We will also make sure that everyone gets a say in the project. We will also get work done in a timely manner to make sure to we do not hinder other members who are relying on that work. In addition, making sure you meet your deliverables every week shows respect to other group members.

## Collaboration
###### Work Distribution 
Each group member is expected to work about 4 hours a week. If we have unexpected complications, or unforeseen work, we can divide up the tasks or if someone has less work for the week or finish early, they can potetnially take upon the task. If a team member feels more comfortable with a certain topic/area of interest, they should take charge of that specfic area.

###### Time Commitment 
When time commitments conflict occur, it is crucial to make sure that we communicate these conflicts to not hinder other group members. Each group member should work around 4 hours a week and should potentially be flexible to work more hours depending on the workload for that week.

###### Conflict Resolution 
If there are disagreements between team members, we can discuss with each other and then come to a consensus among us each other through voting to decide what the end result is. If a member has not accomplished a task, we should talk to them and make sure they understand their role and check if they need any additional help or resources. If there is no help after talking to that member, we will then inform course staff. Hypothetical situations could be if a member is struggling to finish a deliverable, the other members can help them.
