Below we will have three different places to input data. 

The first input will be for running a BFS starting at the inputted airport. The data returned will represent
all the airports you can fly to either directly or with connection flights starting from the inputted airport.

The second input will be for returning an Euler's path, starting at a given airport. The returned data will 
represent the path that will fly every route starting at the inputted airport, without cycling over the same 
route more than once

The third input will take in two airports, and will return the shortest path between those two airports
